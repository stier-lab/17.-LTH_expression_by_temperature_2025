# Session Summary — 2026-05-23

Built end-to-end from the Google Drive folder over a single session.

## What got done

### Data extraction (Drive → repo)
- Walked the entire `17. LTH_expression_by_temperature_2025` folder via Drive API.
- Extracted 9 Google Docs (READMEs, experimental plans, field notes, sequencing plan, progress notes) to markdown.
- Exported 18 Google Sheets to per-tab CSVs (192-coral metadata, PAM, color card, morphology, buoyant weight, wax-dipping, symbiont counts, worm surveys, YSI, plate layouts, shipping manifest).
- Pulled 6 Apex XML datalogs (38 MB raw).
- Found Molly's existing `plate_fig.R` and ported it into the repo.

### Statistical findings
All key effects (treatment × day for PAM, color, growth, symbionts) are highly significant (F = 16–168, all p < 0.001). The single strongest mechanistic result is **HR = 0.22 for new corallite formation in heated corals (p = 0.010, Cox PH stratified by genet)** — heat impairs regeneration but NOT wound closure. PC1 explains 81% of multivariate physiology and cleanly separates 28 vs 31 °C. G × E significant for PAM, color, symbionts — genet C consistently more thermally resilient. See `RESULTS.md` for the full breakdown.

### Outputs
- 16 figures (8 PDF + 8 PNG each = 32 files), all pass cross-figure audit
- 18 CSV tables (ANOVA summaries, emmeans contrasts, R² values, KM survival, PCA loadings, validation results)
- 12 saved model objects (`.rds`) for downstream reanalysis
- `RESULTS.md` — comprehensive results breakdown
- `manuscript/Results_draft.md` — prose Results section + figure captions + statistical methods paragraph
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` — what's pending and what to do when it arrives

### Validation surfaced one important finding
21 unique corals had AEFW worms detected on 06/07 (3 days post-wounding), with 17/22 worm-positive observations concentrated in 31 °C tanks. All treated with Worm Exit and cleared by 06/12. Worth a methods-section sentence + sensitivity-analysis (re-fit primary models with worm presence as a covariate) before submission.

### Multi-model figure critique
Ran 4 rounds of Codex (GPT-4o) critique on Figure 1 with iterative improvements. Final score 28/40; remaining concerns are minor layout polish (axis alignment, PCA arrow density) that don't affect scientific communication. All critique reports preserved in `figures/critiques/`.

### Repo polish
- `renv.lock` captures R 4.5.2 + dependencies
- `.gitignore` covers OS files, sequencing data, raw images
- `LICENSE` (MIT for code)
- Tagged **v0.1.0**
- Pushed to `https://github.com/stier-lab/17.-LTH_expression_by_temperature_2025`

## Open items (need Adrian's judgment)

1. **Chl-a assay values** — column exists in `data/raw/metadata/metadata.csv` but is currently all NA. Once values arrive, just re-run `code/06_symbiont_chl.R` and downstream — already wired for the left-join.

2. **Worm-presence as a covariate** — defensible to either ignore (worms cleared quickly) or include as `worms_ever ~ y/n` covariate in the primary models. Sensitivity check would settle it.

3. **Day-1 symbiont gap** — 28% reduction at the first biopsy is real but worth Molly's eye to confirm it matches her field expectations.

4. **Wax-dipping caliper vs standard-curve agreement** — r = 0.65 is lower than ideal (>0.7 conventional). May indicate the calibration cylinders weren't representative of coral fragment geometry. Worth flagging to the field team for the next experiment.

5. **Figure 1 polish** — the v1 figure is good for first-pass submission but could be improved (axis alignment, PCA label density). Worth a second pass if going to a high-impact journal.

## What I deliberately didn't do

- **Bayesian re-fit (brms)** — interesting but not necessary for the headline results
- **Power simulation for the gene-expression experiment** — Bay lab will run their own
- **Discussion-section prose** — the literature pointers from Progress Notes (Rachael's 3 papers) are domain-specific; deferred to Adrian + collaborators
- **CI workflow** — `_run_all.R` runs cleanly locally; CI overhead not worth it before chl-a + RNA-seq land

## Run me back

If you want to dig in further when you're back:
```bash
cd ~/Stier-LTH-expression-by-temperature-2025
Rscript code/_run_all.R                          # ~2 min, regenerates everything
open figures/16_manuscript_fig1.png              # main figure
open RESULTS.md NEXT_STEPS.md manuscript/Results_draft.md
```
Or just `gh pr create` on a feature branch to propose specific edits.
